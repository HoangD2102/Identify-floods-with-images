Task Description
The goal of this task is to retrieve all images which show direct evidence of a flooding event from social media streams,
independently of a particular event. The objective is to design a system/algorithm that given any collection of multimedia images 
and their metadata (e.g., YFCC100M, Twitter, Wikipedia, news articles) is able to identify those images that are related to a flooding event. 
Please note, that only those images which convey an evidence of a flooding event will be considered as True Positives. Specifically,
we define images showing unexpected high water levels in industrial, residential, commercial and agricultural areasâ€œ as images providing evidence of a flooding event. 
The main challenges of this task are the proper discrimination of the water level in different areas (e.g., 
images showing a lake vs. showing high water at a street) as well as the consideration of different types of flooding events (e.g., coastal flooding, river flooding, pluvial flooding).

What data is provided?
The images and corresponding metadata for this task have been extracted from YFCC100M-Dataset. These images are shared under Creative Commons licenses that allow their redistribution. All images are sampled in a way such that there is only one image per user in the dataset. Images will be labeled with the two classes (1) Showing evidence of a flooding event and (2) Showing no evidence of a flooding event. In addition to the images, we will also supply participants with additional metadata information. We will release a development set of 5280 images. Precomputed features will be provided along with the dataset to help teams from different communities to participate to the task.
